# Advanced Prompting Techniques

## Context Window Optimization

1. **Reference Compression**
   - Summarize long code/documents before reference
   - Example: "Here's a summary of our 2000-line codebase: [concise description]. Now help me implement a new feature that..."

2. **Selective Information Sharing**
   - Share only relevant portions of large documents
   - Example: "From our API docs, here are the relevant endpoints: [paste relevant sections only]"

3. **Continuation Chaining**
   - Use explicit markers for continuing work across context limits
   - Example: "This is part 2 of our database schema design. Continuing from where we left off with the user authentication tables..."

## Multi-Tool Integration

1. **Tool Specialization**
   - Use different AI models for their strengths
   - Example: "I'll use Claude for system design, GitHub Copilot for implementation, and GPT-4 for documentation"

2. **Workflow Automation**
   - Create scripts or shortcuts for common AI interactions
   - Example: Shell aliases for common AI commands or VS Code snippets for prompt templates

3. **Output Processing**
   - Use one AI to review/improve another's output
   - Example: "Review this code generated by GitHub Copilot for security vulnerabilities and performance issues"

## Progressive Refinement

1. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Start with a basic version and refine in steps
   - Example: "First, generate a simple implementation. Then, we'll optimize it for performance."

2. **Targeted Follow-ups**
   - Use specific follow-up prompts to improve initial results
   - Example: "That's a good start. Now, let's enhance the error handling to cover these edge cases..."

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Request multiple approaches and compare pros/cons
   - Example: "Generate three different approaches to this problem, then analyze the tradeoffs"

## Structured Reasoning

1. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
   - Ask the AI to reason step-by-step before providing final answer
   - Example: "Think through this problem step-by-step, explaining your reasoning at each stage."

2. **Self-Critique**
   - Have the AI evaluate its own initial response before finalizing
   - Example: "Before finalizing your answer, review your solution for potential issues or optimizations."

3. **Expert Personas**
   - Frame requests as coming from specific expert perspectives
   - Example: "Analyze this code first as a security expert, then as a performance engineer."

## Advanced Output Control

1. **Format Specification**
   - Provide explicit templates for desired output format
   - Example: "Format your response as a JSON object with these specific fields..."

2. **Conditional Instructions**
   - Include context-dependent behavior in prompts
   - Example: "If the code is Python, include type hints. If JavaScript, use JSDoc comments."

3. **Precision vs. Creativity Control**
   - Specify required balance between deterministic answers and creative exploration
   - Example: "For this coding task, prioritize correctness over creativity. Follow established patterns exactly."
