# Visual-DNA Report — Hank’s Luxury-Monogram Preferences

_(purely preference-oriented; no prompt text)_

| Dimension               | “Must-Have” Characteristics                                                                       | “Nice-to-Have / Lean-Toward”                               | “Definitely Avoid”                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Concept**        | Monogram formed by **one or two initials** (interlaced / nested)                                  | Subtle ligature tricks that feel bespoke                   | Wordmarks, icon+slogan lock-ups                                |
| **Letterforms**         | High-contrast modern **serifs**; razor-thin hairlines + bold stems; calligraphic curves           | Micro-flourishes that hint at pen strokes; gentle tapering | Geometric sans, slab serifs, script fonts that look ornamental |
| **Geometry & Layout**   | **Perfectly centred** inside a square; disciplined negative space around mark                     | Slight diagonal interplay or mirrored symmetry             | Off-centre placement, dense pattern fills                      |
| **Scale & Proportion**  | 60–70 % of canvas occupied by glyph; optically balanced counters                                  | Counter-space forming hidden shapes                        | Oversized marks that kiss edges or look cramped                |
| **Colour System**       | Single, **neutral monochrome** per logo:  • ivory • dove-grey • charcoal black • warm taupe/brown | Off-white or cool greys in mock-ups                        | Bright hues, metallic foils, duotones, gradients               |
| **Material & Finish**   | **Emboss / deboss** impression on tactile stock (cotton paper, suede-textured card, soft leather) | Micro-grain paper fibres visible under raking light        | Flat vector mock-ups, glossy plastic finishes                  |
| **Lighting**            | Soft, directional light to yield gentle high-lights & shadows on relief                           | Subtle vignette that draws eye to centre                   | Hard specular highlights, multi-directional shadows            |
| **Mood / Brand Voice**  | _Timeless_, _sophisticated_, boutique-fashion elegance                                            | Understated confidence, Zen restraint                      | Loud luxury, maximalist ornamentation, vintage flourishes      |
| **Negative-Space Play** | Intentional inner blanks that create breathing room or hidden motifs                              | Letterform cut-outs or counters echoing curves elsewhere   | Filled counters, clutter, drop-shadows                         |
| **Supporting Graphics** | None — allow the monogram + surface texture to speak alone                                        | Discreet bounding oval (only if monogram feels too adrift) | Icons, crests, laurels, shadows, gradients, borders            |

## Preference Heuristics (How to “Tell” if a Logo Fits)

1. **Squint test** → Must still read as a single sculptural shape; no busy edges.
2. **Counter check** → All negative areas feel intentional and balanced (avoid accidental blobs).
3. **Surface fatigue** → Emboss depth should be noticeable yet subtle; if paper grain overpowers letterform, pull back.
4. **Colour isolation** → View the design in pure monochrome first; if it needs colour to feel complete, it isn’t minimal enough.
5. **Ligature friction** → Ligature strokes must feel like natural pen sweeps, not digital stitch-ons.

## Personal Red-Flags

- Serif contrasts that are _too_ sharp → veer into “techno-didone” territory.
- Over-flourished calligraphy that compromises first-read legibility.
- Stock mock-ups with shiny metallic foil or busy marble backdrops.
- Initials spaced so widely they read as two separate logos, not a unified mark.

### Snapshot Summary

Your visual DNA centres on **disciplined minimalism + tactile luxury**: a carefully sculpted monogram, floating in calm whitespace, pressed into noble materials, and whispered in an elegant neutral. Anything decorative must earn its keep through subtlety and purpose.
