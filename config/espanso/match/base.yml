# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ";es"
    replace: "espanso"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!
