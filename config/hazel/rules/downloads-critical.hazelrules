# Purpose: Automatically clean up old installer files
# Status: ACTIVE (Phase 1 - Critical Only)

# Implementation Notes:
# - Import this rule into Hazel app manually: Hazel → Downloads → Import Rules
# - 7-day window is enough time to install any application
# - Low risk: DMG files are always re-downloadable
# - High value: Prevents Downloads folder from filling with installers

# Future Rules (Available in archive/downloads-lifecycle.hazelrules):
# - PDF categorization (1 day)
# - Image processing (2 days)
# - Old file archival (30 days)
# - ZIP cleanup (7 days for files <100 MB)
