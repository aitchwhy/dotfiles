Git add, commit, and push in one step.

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand all changes
2. Stage the relevant changed files with `git add` (prefer specific files over `git add -A`)
3. Draft a conventional commit message: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, perf, ci
   - Lowercase first letter in description
   - Keep it concise (1 line)
4. Commit with the message
5. Push to the remote

If there are no changes to commit, say so and stop.
