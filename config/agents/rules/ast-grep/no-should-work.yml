  ASSUMPTION LANGUAGE VIOLATION detected.

  Ban assumption language. Replace with evidence:

    // BAD
    // This should work
    // It's probably fine
    // I think this is correct

    // GOOD
    // Verified via test: auth.test.ts:42
    // Error output shows: [actual output]
    // Confirmed by running: bun test

  UNVERIFIED claims must be marked explicitly:
    // UNVERIFIED: requires test_name

  See verification-first skill.
