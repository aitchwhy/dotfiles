# Provider-Specific Configurations

This directory contains configurations, optimizations, and templates tailored for specific AI providers and models.

## Structure

- **Claude/**: Anthropic Claude-specific configurations and optimizations
- **OpenAI/**: OpenAI GPT models configurations and best practices
- **Gemini/**: Google Gemini-specific templates and settings
- **Cursor/**: Cursor IDE AI integration configurations

## Key Components

- Provider-specific system messages and configurations
- Model-specific optimization techniques
- Configuration files for AI tools and integrations
- Templates optimized for particular model capabilities

## Usage

Use these resources to:
1. Optimize prompts for specific AI models
2. Configure AI tools for optimal performance
3. Leverage unique capabilities of different providers
4. Address model-specific limitations or requirements

## Best Practices

- Test provider-specific optimizations to ensure they produce better results
- Be aware of version-specific features that may change with model updates
- When possible, maintain model-agnostic versions of critical prompts
- Document specific capabilities or limitations of each model
