# Core Prompting

This directory contains fundamental prompting techniques, base templates, and system roles that form the foundation of effective AI interactions.

## Structure

- **Base_Templates/**: Generic templates that can be adapted for various purposes
- **System_Roles/**: Definitions that shape AI behavior and capabilities
- **Best_Practices/**: Guidelines and principles for effective prompt engineering

## Key Components

- Base system messages for different AI interactions
- Universal prompt structures that work across various models
- Core prompt engineering principles and techniques
- Fundamental strategies for context management and output control

## Usage

These base components are designed to be combined with more specific templates from other directories. They provide the foundational structure that can be extended with domain-specific content.

Example workflow:
1. Start with an appropriate system role from `System_Roles/`
2. Add a base template structure from `Base_Templates/`
3. Incorporate domain-specific content from the `Use_Cases/` directory
4. Add any provider-specific optimizations if needed

## Best Practices

- Keep system roles concise but comprehensive
- Use consistent formatting and structure across all prompts
- Maintain clear separation between instructions and content
- Balance specificity with flexibility to allow the AI appropriate latitude
