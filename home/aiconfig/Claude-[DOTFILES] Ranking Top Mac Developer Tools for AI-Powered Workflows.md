Based on the analysis, here are the key findings:

1.  Visual Studio Code (45/50) emerges as the top choice, primarily due to:

*   Exceptional AI integration through GitHub Copilot and other AI extensions
*   Comprehensive keyboard-driven workflow with customizable shortcuts
*   Rich extension ecosystem with over 30,000 extensions
*   Regular updates with modern features while maintaining performance

2.  JetBrains IDEs (44/50) come in as a close second:

*   Built-in AI assistant with strong code analysis
*   Powerful refactoring capabilities and debugging tools
*   Native performance and deep language-specific features
*   Excellent keyboard control with IDE-wide search

3.  Nova, Zed, and Sublime Text (tied at 37/50) offer different strengths:

*   Nova excels in native macOS integration and design
*   Zed brings innovative multiplayer features and modern performance
*   Sublime Text offers unmatched speed and keyboard efficiency

The scoring particularly emphasizes the growing importance of AI integration and keyboard-driven workflows in modern development tools, while still valuing traditional aspects like extensibility and core development features.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the comparison or explain the reasoning behind particular scores?

## Prompt:
how can I capture all installed apps (cli+gui+pkgs) all on text file on mac os? installed from homebrew, dmg, pkgs, brew bundle, app store

## Response:
I'll help you create a comprehensive solution to capture all installed applications on your macOS system. Let me create a script that will aggregate information from different sources.

macOS Apps Export Script

Click to open code

This script creates a comprehensive export of all installed applications on your Mac. Here's how to use it:

1.  Save the script as `capture-mac-apps.sh`
2.  Make it executable: `chmod +x capture-mac-apps.sh`
3.  Run it: `./capture-mac-apps.sh`

The script will create a detailed export that includes:

1.  All applications in your /Applications directory
2.  Mac App Store applications (requires `mas` CLI tool)
3.  Homebrew formulae and casks
4.  A complete Brewfile for easy reinstallation
5.  System package receipts (installed .pkg files)
6.  Command line tools from common locations
7.  Node.js global packages
8.  Python pip packages
9.  Ruby gems
10.  VS Code extensions

The output will be saved on your Desktop in a folder called `mac-apps-export` with a timestamp, making it easy to track changes over time.

For the best results, ensure you have these tools installed:

```bash
brew install mas   # For Mac App Store apps
brew install terminal-notifier   # For notifications (optional)
```

The script is designed to gracefully handle cases where certain package managers aren't installed, so it will still work even if you don't have all package managers installed.

To make this script even more useful, you could add it to your regular backup routine or run it periodically using `cron`. Would you like me to explain how to set up automated running of this script?

## Prompt:
clean following zsh dotfiles files (e.g. zshrc) code up to be valid working state but keep all dependencies and configs possible and then optimize

## Response:
Let me help you optimize and clean up the zsh configuration files. I'll analyze and refactor the code while keeping the functionality and organizing it in a more maintainable way.

Optimized ZSH Configuration

*   Modern CLI tools integration (bat, ripgrep, fzf, etc.)
*   Development environment setup (Node.js, Python, etc.)
*   Comprehensive Git workflows
*   Dotfile management with chezmoi
*   Shell enhancements (zoxide, atuin, etc.)

4.  New Improvements:

*   Better error messages for missing dependencies
*   More consistent alias naming
*   Clearer documentation
*   Proper XDG base directory support
*   Better history management

bbsave    # Save and backup Brewfile via chezmoi
```

Would you like me to add any additional Homebrew-specific configurations or explain any part in more detail?

## Prompt:
is the path ordering correct? which shoudl be first?

## Response:
Let me analyze the path ordering based on the `brew shellenv` output and best practices.

From your `brew shellenv` output, we can see this order:

```bash
PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:                # Homebrew paths
/Users/hank/.local/state/fnm_multishells/65442_.../bin:   # FNM Node paths
/usr/local/bin:                                           # System local
/Users/hank/.local/bin:/Users/hank/bin:                   # User local
/Users/hank/.bun/bin:                                     # Bun
/Users/hank/go/bin:                                       # Go
/Users/hank/.cache/lm-studio/bin:                         # LM Studio
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:                           # System paths
..."                                                      # Other paths
```

Let me update the path configuration to ensure the correct priority order:

Optimized ZSH Configuration

Click to open code

The updated path ordering follows these principles:

1.  **Package Manager First**
    *   Homebrew paths come first to ensure package-managed binaries take precedence
2.  **Version Managers & Language Runtimes**
    *   FNM (Node.js version manager)
    *   Language-specific paths (Bun, Python, Rust, Deno, Go)
    *   These need to be high priority to ensure correct version management
3.  **User Binaries**
    *   Local user overrides come next
    *   Allows user-installed binaries to override system versions when needed
4.  **System Local**
    *   /usr/local paths for locally compiled software
5.  **App-Specific Paths**
    *   Application-specific binaries like LM Studio
6.  **System Paths**
    *   Standard system binary locations
    *   macOS-specific paths
    *   Lower priority ensures they don't override user/package manager choices
7.  **Application Paths**
    *   Specific application binary paths
    *   Lowest priority as they're usually accessed directly

This ordering ensures:

*   Package-managed software takes precedence
*   Version managers work correctly
*   User overrides are respected
*   System binaries don't interfere with custom installations

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this path ordering or explain any specific part in more detail?

## Prompt:
> The generated artifact uses libraries we don't support: `@/components/ui/table`

Can you fix this error in `dev-tools-comparison`?

## Response:
I apologize for using the unsupported shadcn/ui table component. Let me fix the React component to use only native HTML table elements with Tailwind's core utility classes.

Developer Tools Comparison

Click to open component

I've made the following changes:

1.  Removed the shadcn/ui table component dependency
2.  Replaced it with native HTML `<table>` elements
3.  Used only Tailwind's core utility classes for styling
4.  Added proper borders and spacing
5.  Included alternating row colors for better readability
6.  Added a score explanation footer
7.  Maintained all the original functionality and data

The component now uses only standard React and core Tailwind CSS classes, with no additional dependencies. The table is still fully responsive and maintains a clean, professional appearance.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the styling or layout?
