## Prompt:
best way to add nix binary installation to my dotfiles (Github repo committed) so it is installed automatically on new Mac OSX machines? I run "bootstrap.sh" on new machines so I can include it as shell install command. But also I could add it to my bashrc or zshrc

## Response:
To automatically install Nix on new Mac OSX machines using your dotfiles repository, you can follow these steps:

1.  Add the Nix installation command to your `bootstrap.sh` script:

```bash
# Install Nix
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
```

This command downloads and runs the Nix installation script, which installs Nix on your Mac OSX system.

2.  Configure your shell to use Nix by adding the following lines to your `bashrc` or `zshrc` file:

```bash
# Nix
if [ -e ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh ]; then
  . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
fi
```

This code checks if the Nix profile script exists and sources it, enabling Nix in your shell environment.

3.  Commit the changes to your dotfiles repository:

```bash
git add bootstrap.sh bashrc zshrc
git commit -m "Add Nix installation and configuration"
git push
```

Now, when you run `bootstrap.sh` on a new Mac OSX machine, it will automatically install Nix and configure your shell to use it.

Alternatively, if you prefer to keep the Nix installation separate from your `bootstrap.sh` script, you can create a dedicated script for installing Nix (e.g., `install_nix.sh`) and add it to your dotfiles repository. Then, you can manually run this script on new machines or invoke it from your `bootstrap.sh` script.

```bash
# install_nix.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Install Nix
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --darwin-use-unencrypted-nix-store-volume
```

Make sure to make the script executable (`chmod +x install_nix.sh`) before committing it to your repository.

By following these steps, you can easily automate the installation of Nix on new Mac OSX machines using your dotfiles repository.
