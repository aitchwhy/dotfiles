# Configuration Directory

All application settings are stored in the `config/` folder following the XDG standard. Each tool lives in its own subdirectory so the entire folder can be linked into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or managed by Home Manager.

Refer to [docs/dotfiles-best-practices-2025.md](../docs/dotfiles-best-practices-2025.md) for guidelines on keeping these configs working together.
For the smallest possible setup see [docs/minimal-configs.md](../docs/minimal-configs.md).
