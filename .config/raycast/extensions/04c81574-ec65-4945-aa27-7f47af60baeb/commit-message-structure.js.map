Alternatively a `!` can be appended after the type/scope of the commit.\n  \n  It can be part of any type of commit.\n  \n  ```\n  feat!: allow provided config object to extend other configs\n\n  BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files\n  ```\n  \n  ## Examples\n\n  ### Commit message with scope\n  ```\n  build(deps): upgrade packages`\n  ```\n  \n  ### Reverting a commit message\n  ```\n  revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident\n\n  Refs: 676104e, a215868\n  ```\n\n  ### Commit message with breaking change footer and type suffix\n  ```\n  chore!: drop support for Node 6\n\n  BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.\n  ```\n  \"\n    />\n  );\n}\n"],
