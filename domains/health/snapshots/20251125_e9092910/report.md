#### Recommendations

**[HIGH] Respiratory**
- Finding: 7.7% of nights with SpO2 < 95%
- Action: Screen for sleep apnea. Consider sleep study (polysomnography). Review sleeping position and nasal breathing.
- Medical Note: Frequent desaturations during sleep warrant medical evaluation for OSA.

**[HIGH] Sleep**
- Finding: Insufficient sleep duration (6.3 hours avg)
- Action: Aim for 7-9 hours. Establish consistent sleep/wake times. Create sleep-conducive environment (dark, cool, quiet).
- Medical Note: Chronic sleep deprivation increases risk of obesity, diabetes, and CVD.

**[HIGH] Sleep Debt**
- Finding: Chronic sleep debt (71.0 min average)
- Action: Prioritize sleep extension. Consider 20-min naps if needed. Address root causes of sleep restriction.
- Medical Note: Sleep debt accumulates and cannot be fully repaid with catch-up nights.

**[HIGH] Recovery**
- Finding: High percentage of poor recovery days (32.8%)
- Action: Review training load vs recovery balance. Consider deload weeks. Optimize nutrition, hydration, and stress management.
- Medical Note: Chronic under-recovery increases injury risk and may indicate overtraining.

#### Alerts
- **WARNING**: High proportion of poor recovery days: 32.8%
