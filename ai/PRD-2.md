# Product Requirements Document

This document captures the requirements, preferences, and design principles for the dotfiles repository as expressed by the user in conversations.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Repository Structure

- **Modular Organization**: Configuration files must be organized in a modular structure by tool
- **Consistent Naming**: Directory names should match tool identifiers used throughout the repository
- **XDG Compliance**: Follow XDG Base Directory specification for all configurations
- **Documentation**: Each tool must have its own README with usage instructions

### 2. Installation and Setup

- **Idempotent Setup**: Setup script must be runnable multiple times without causing issues
- **Backup Mechanism**: Automatically back up existing configurations before overwriting
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to a minimum
- **Consistent Symlinking**: Use symlinks consistently (entire directories when possible)
- **Cross-platform Support**: Primary focus on macOS (Apple Silicon), but avoid architecture-specific code when possible

### 3. Tool Integration

- **Unified Task Runner**: Use Just to provide a consistent interface for commands
- **Fuzzy Finding**: Enable fuzzy search capabilities for commands
- **Hierarchical Commands**: Commands should be organized by tool and accessible via prefix
- **Shell Integration**: Integrate with ZSH for immediate access to commands

### 4. Visual and UX Preferences

- **Tokyo Night Theme**: Consistent Tokyo Night theme across all tools
- **Modern Terminal**: GPU-accelerated terminal with Ghostty
- **Vim-style Navigation**: Vim-inspired navigation in all supporting tools
- **Clean Interface**: Minimize visual clutter in terminal and UI
- **Performance Optimization**: Configure for Apple Silicon performance

### 6. Documentation Standards

- **Consistent Format**: All documentation should follow a consistent format
- **Code Examples**: Include useful code examples for common operations
- **Installation Instructions**: Clear installation instructions for each tool
- **Customization Guide**: Document how to customize each configuration
- **Version Information**: Track versions of all tools

### 7. Version Control

- **Clean Commits**: Commits should have clear, descriptive messages
- **Atomic Changes**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Version Tracking**: Maintain a VERSION.md file with current environment snapshot

## Design Principles

1. **Minimalism**: Keep configurations simple and focused
2. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and responsiveness
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and behaviors across tools
4. **Modularity**: Enable easy addition/removal of specific configurations
5. **Discoverability**: Make features and commands easy to discover
6. **Documentation**: Document everything thoroughly
7. **Maintainability**: Code should be clean and well-organized

## Constraints

1. **macOS-focused**: Primary platform is macOS on Apple Silicon
2. **ZSH-centric**: Shell configuration is centered around ZSH
3. **Modern tools**: Focus on modern, actively maintained tools
4. **Performance**: Must maintain fast shell startup times
5. **Backwards compatibility**: Support for older versions is not a priority

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Tool Integration**: Support for more development tools
2. **Automation**: Further automate setup and maintenance tasks
3. **Enhanced Documentation**: More comprehensive guides and examples
4. **Cross-platform**: Better support for Linux and other platforms
5. **Testing**: Add automated testing for configurations
