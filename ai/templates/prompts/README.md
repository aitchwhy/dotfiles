# AI Prompts (Best Practices & Resources)

## General Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

1. **Be Specific and Explicit**
   - Provide clear context, constraints, and expected outputs
   - Example: "Write a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by the 'date' key in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)"

2. **Use Structured Formats**
   - Bullet points for requirements
   - Numbered lists for sequential steps
   - Headers for organizing complex prompts
   - Example: "Requirements: • Must handle null values • Must be thread-safe • Must complete in O(n) time"

3. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Start with a basic prompt, then refine based on results
   - Save effective prompts as templates for reuse
   - Example follow-up: "The solution works but needs better error handling for invalid inputs"

4. **Leverage System Messages**
   - Set persistent instructions in system prompts or chat settings
   - Define roles and output preferences clearly
   - Example: "You are an expert Python developer focusing on clean, maintainable code with comprehensive error handling"

## Domain-Specific Strategies

### Coding Excellence

1. **Problem Decomposition**
   - Break complex problems into specific components
   - Request system design before implementation
   - Example: "First outline the architecture for this authentication system, then we'll implement each component"

2. **Request Multiple Approaches**
   - Ask for alternative implementations with tradeoffs
   - Example: "Show me two different approaches to solving this problem - one optimized for readability, one for performance"

3. **Pair Programming Flow**
   - Use AI as a pair programming partner
   - Alternate between generating code and reviewing/refactoring
   - Example: "Let's implement this feature step by step. First, the user authentication logic..."

4. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Request tests before or alongside implementation
   - Example: "Write unit tests for this function before implementing it"

5. **Debug Collaboratively**
   - Share error messages and stack traces verbatim
   - Provide context on what you've already tried
   - Example: "I'm getting this error when running the code: [paste error]. I've tried X and Y without success"

### Research & Search Optimization

1. **Question Refinement**
   - Start broad, then narrow through follow-ups
   - Example: "What are modern approaches to database sharding?" → "How would these sharding techniques apply to time-series data?"

2. **Comparative Analysis Requests**
   - Ask for structured comparisons of alternatives
   - Example: "Compare Redis, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL for storing session data with these criteria: scalability, persistence, query complexity, operational overhead"

3. **Synthesis Requests**
   - Request summary of complex topics with key takeaways
   - Example: "Summarize the key developments in transformer architecture since 2020, focusing on efficiency improvements"

4. **Knowledge Stacking**
   - Build on previous responses with targeted follow-ups
   - Example: "Based on these database options, what would be the implementation challenges for our specific traffic pattern?"

### Data Analysis Workflows

1. **Analysis Planning**
   - Request analysis approach before execution
   - Example: "What analysis approach would you recommend for detecting seasonal patterns in this customer data?"

2. **Visualization Guidance**
   - Ask for specific visualization recommendations
   - Example: "What would be the best visualization approach to show the relationship between these three variables?"

3. **Interpretation Assistance**
   - Share data summaries for AI interpretation
   - Example: "Here are the key statistics from my analysis. What patterns or anomalies stand out to you?"

4. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Use AI to generate testable hypotheses
   - Example: "Based on these initial findings, what hypotheses should we test to understand the drop in conversion rate?"

### Email & Communication Mastery

1. **Audience-Focused Templates**
   - Create templates for different audiences (technical, executive, client)
   - Example: "Draft an email explaining this technical issue to a non-technical client"

2. **Tone Calibration**
   - Specify desired tone and provide examples
   - Example: "Write a response to this customer complaint that's empathetic but maintains boundaries"

3. **Content Structuring**
   - Request specific structures for complex communication
   - Example: "Structure this project update with: accomplishments, challenges, next steps, and resource needs"

4. **Response Generation**
   - Provide email context and request response options
   - Example: "Here's an email from a client asking for rush delivery. Generate three response options ranging from accommodating to firmly maintaining our timeline"

## Advanced Techniques

### Context Window Optimization

1. **Reference Compression**
   - Summarize long code/documents before reference
   - Example: "Here's a summary of our 2000-line codebase: [concise description]. Now help me implement a new feature that..."

2. **Selective Information Sharing**
   - Share only relevant portions of large documents
   - Example: "From our API docs, here are the relevant endpoints: [paste relevant sections only]"

3. **Continuation Chaining**
   - Use explicit markers for continuing work across context limits
   - Example: "This is part 2 of our database schema design. Continuing from where we left off with the user authentication tables..."

### Multi-Tool Integration

1. **Tool Specialization**
   - Use different AI models for their strengths
   - Example: "I'll use Claude for system design, GitHub Copilot for implementation, and GPT-4 for documentation"

2. **Workflow Automation**
   - Create scripts or shortcuts for common AI interactions
   - Example: Shell aliases for common AI commands or VS Code snippets for prompt templates

3. **Output Processing**
   - Use one AI to review/improve another's output
   - Example: "Review this code generated by GitHub Copilot for security vulnerabilities and performance issues"
