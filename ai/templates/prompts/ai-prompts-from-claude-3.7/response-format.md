# Response Formatting Guidelines

## Document Structure

### Hierarchical Organization
- Use clear hierarchical headers (H1, H2, H3) for logical organization
- Ensure headers create a scannable outline of the content
- Maintain consistent heading levels for parallel concepts
- Keep header text concise and descriptive

### Content Blocks
- Separate distinct concepts with visual breaks
- Use bullet points for lists of related items
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps or ranked items
- Group related information in cohesive sections

### Progressive Disclosure
- Present most important information first
- Start with summary/overview before details
- Use expandable sections for supplementary details when appropriate
- Structure from general to specific

## Visual Elements

### Tables
For comparisons and structured data:
- Include 5-7 crucial criteria from modern best practices
- Score each option 1-10 for each criterion
- Apply appropriate weights when criteria importance varies
- Present options in descending order of overall score
- Include scoring rationale in the table or notes
- Add a clear explanation for the top choice selection

Example format:
```
| Option | Criterion 1 (w=0.3) | Criterion 2 (w=0.5) | Criterion 3 (w=0.2) | Weighted Score | Rationale |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Opt A  | 9 (2.7)             | 7 (3.5)             | 8 (1.6)             | 7.8            | Excels at... |
```

### Diagrams
For complex relationships, include diagrams that show:
- System architecture with components and interfaces
- Workflow sequences with decision points
- Entity relationships with cardinality
- Data transformations and processing pipelines
- Algorithm mechanisms with step transitions

Diagram guidelines:
- Clear labels on all elements
- Logical flow direction (typically left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
- Concise legends when using symbols
- Visual hierarchy that emphasizes important elements

### Code Formatting
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Include meaningful comments at logical breakpoints
- Add type annotations when helpful
- Demonstrate best practices in the code structure
- Include example usage when not obvious

## Content Quality

### Technical Precision
- Use correct terminology consistently
- Cite specific versions/tools when version-dependent
- Avoid vague generalizations
- Qualify claims with supporting evidence or reasoning

### Implementation Focus
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Include specific configuration samples
- Provide resource requirements and constraints
- Address practical implementation considerations

### Balanced Detail
- Provide comprehensive information without verbosity
- Emphasize distinctive or non-obvious aspects
- De-emphasize standard or expected behaviors
- Adjust detail level based on complexity and importance

## Special Content Types

### Process Descriptions
- Break down into clear sequential steps
- Indicate expected outcomes at key points
- Note potential failure points and mitigation
- Include validation methods for each stage

### Analysis Outputs
- Clearly state assumptions and methodology
- Present findings with supporting evidence
- Discuss limitations and confidence levels
- Include actionable conclusions

### Technical Evaluations
- Establish clear evaluation criteria
- Use consistent rating system
- Provide specific examples supporting ratings
- Include quantitative metrics when available

## Document Formatting

### Text Styling
- Use bold for emphasis of key terms and concepts
- Use italic for secondary emphasis or specialized terms
- Use code formatting for commands, variables, and technical identifiers
- Maintain consistent styling conventions throughout

### Lists and Indentation
- Use bulleted lists for unordered collections
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Indent sublists consistently
- Keep list items parallel in structure

### Code Blocks
- Use triple backticks with language specification
- Format code with consistent indentation
- Break long lines appropriately
- Include sample output when helpful
