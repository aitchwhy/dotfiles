# QUICK HOW-TO
###############################################################################
# 1. Save this file as   ~/.config/brewfile/Brewfile   (or any path you like).
# 2. Uncomment the taps/formulae/casks you actually want installed.
# 3. Run:     brew bundle --file <path>   (or   brew bundle --global   if you
#    keep it in the default global location).
# 4. To prune things later:   brew bundle cleanup --force --file <path>

# ## Run `brew tap` with a custom URL
# tap "user/tap-repo", "https://user@bitbucket.org/user/homebrew-tap-repo.git"
#
# # Set arguments passed to all `brew install --cask` commands for `cask "..."`
# # In this example, pass `--appdir=~/Applications` and `--require_sha`
# cask_args appdir: "~/Applications", require_sha: true
#
# # Pass options to non-Homebrew/core formulae e.g. `brew install denji/nginx/nginx-full --with-rmtp`
# # This also runs `brew link --overwrite nginx-full` and `brew services restart nginx-full` afterwards.
# brew "denji/nginx/nginx-full", link: :overwrite, args: ["with-rmtp"], restart_service: :always
#
# # Runs `brew install mysql@5.6`, `brew services restart mysql@5.6` only if it was was installed or upgraded,
# # `brew link mysql@5.6` and `brew unlink mysql` (if `mysql` is installed)
# brew "mysql@5.6", restart_service: :changed, link: true, conflicts_with: ["mysql"]
#
# # Runs `brew install postgresql@16` and then runs a postinstall command if `postgresql@16` was installed or upgraded.
# brew "postgresql@16",
#      postinstall: "${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/opt/postgresql@16/bin/postgres -D ${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/var/postgresql@16"
#
# # Runs `brew install ruby` and, afterwards, writes the installed version to the '.ruby-version` file.
# brew "ruby", version_file: ".ruby-version"
#
# # Runs `brew install gnupg` or `brew install glibc` only on the specified OS.
# # Note: `brew bundle list` will not output `gnupg` on Linux or `glibc` on macOS` in this case:
# # the Ruby logic means they are "hidden" on other platforms.
# brew "gnupg" if OS.mac?
# brew "glibc" if OS.linux?
#
# # Runs `brew install --cask --appdir=~/my-apps/Applications`
# cask "firefox", args: { appdir: "~/my-apps/Applications" }
#
# # Runs `brew upgrade opera` to upgrade an auto-updated or unversioned Opera cask
# # to the latest version even if already installed.
# # This is used to force an upgrade in software that would typically update itself.
# cask "opera", greedy: true
#
# # Runs `brew install --cask java` only if '/usr/libexec/java_home --failfast` fails (i.e there is no Java)
# # Note: `brew bundle list` will not output `java` if this `system` command succeeds and
# # this `system` command will be run even on `brew bundle check`, not just `brew bundle install`.
# cask "java" unless system "/usr/libexec/java_home", "--failfast"
#
# # Runs `brew install --cask` and runs the command if the Google Cloud cask was installed or upgraded.
# cask "google-cloud-sdk", postinstall: "${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/gcloud components update"
#
# # Sets an environment variable to be used e.g. inside `brew bundle exec` or `system` commands in the `Brewfile`.
# # Note: HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin is _not_ in the `PATH` by default so you can set it this way.
