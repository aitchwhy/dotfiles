# QUICK HOW-TO
###############################################################################
# 1. Save this file as   ~/.config/brewfile/Brewfile   (or any path you like).
# 2. Uncomment the taps/formulae/casks you actually want installed.
# 3. Run:     brew bundle --file <path>   (or   brew bundle --global   if you
#    keep it in the default global location).
# 4. To prune things later:   brew bundle cleanup --force --file <path>
#
# Happy brewing! üç∫
